PopUpGardens is an NSF funded collaboration between the <a href="http://jillahamilton.com/index.html">Hamilton</a>, <a href="https://forestgenomics.frec.vt.edu/">Holliday</a>, <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~kellrlab/index.html">Keller</a>, and <a href="https://mfitzpatrick.al.umces.edu/Site/Welcome.html">Fitzpatrick</a> labs. We are planting gardens of black cottonwood (_Populus trichocarpa_), balsam poplar (_Populus balsamifera_) and their hybrids across the United States. Each garden will be planted with the same set of genetically identical individuals to study how genetic variation creates differences in physical, physiological, and developmental traits.

<h1 class="text-left">This project features two classes of common gardens. Three large maxi-gardens, each with over 500 unique genotypes and 1500 trees, have been planted at the North Dakota State University Agricultural Experimental Station, the University of Vermont, and Virgina Tech Reynolds Homestead Forest Resources Research Center.
Eighteen smaller mini-gardens, each with the same set of 50 genotypes and 100 trees, have been planted at partner universities and arboreta. These gardens will provide valuable information of how phenotypes for these trees change over a wide range of climatic variation.

PopUp Poplar gardens are established with naturally occuring poplar hybirds, collecte from Washington state to Alaska along six coast-to-interior transects. Phenotypic data collected from PopUp Poplar gardens will be combined with DNA sequence data to study the genetic basis for adaptation to variable climates, the role of hybrids and stable hybrid zones in this process, and how GxG and GxGxE interactions contribute to adaptive phenotypes </h1>
