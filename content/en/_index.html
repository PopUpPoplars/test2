PopUp Poplars is an NSF funded collaboration between eighteen univiersities and arborea across the United States. Our research partners are managing a common gardens of naturally occuring hybrid poplar trees.

We will pair phenotypic data from each garden with genome sequencing to identify gene by environment interactions and gene by gene by environment interactions. We will also map this genetic variation back to the genomes of the parental species to identify when hybrid genomes result in unique phenotypes across the environment.

The objective of this work is to characterize the adaptive variation in natural poplar stands, further explore the importance of hybridization in climatic adaptation, and predict poplar distributions with climate change.

These gardens also serve as an open and available resource for education. With our arboreteum partners we introduce classrooms of all ages to scientific thinking, ecological principles, and a life-long love for plants.
